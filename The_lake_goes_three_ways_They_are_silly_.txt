as of late, prota bother denys it and theartens her sister with no dessert

#delegadax
Prota tells her about she made a group with delegadax before he can continue much she is looking at him "funny", he would be upset cause he knows 
what she is thinking and she would probally encourage her brother to go with it
she says she sound like a really nice gal and would make a good paring with him, he would get annoyed at her yet again trying to get him with a girl in her head, 
she would refute that she is quite close with her and it would make a lot of sence, after all she has always been kind to him
he would refute that in of itself is the problem "she is too nice a lot of people take advantage of her, she needs to stand up for herself", her sister would laugh 
under him telling "so now you are his knight to defend her honor~?" or something of sorths
he would fluster and say that she shouldnt get that weird ideas, that he just doesnt like people taking advantage of other, she wouldnt belive him but fake agreement 
while still smiling
he would be annoyed in his head but sighing and just giving up "when something gets into her mind is difficult to get out i guess"

#sportsmaster
Prota tells her about what accoured and how in the end they made two groups to make something toghter, 
she would be very upset that profesor wouldnt let the friends get one group "that sounds really dumb" or something like that
prota would agree but excuse the profesor saying "it probally something about the upper management", she would sigh and say 
something about higher up people never seeing the individuals problems and just seeing "the all" and not what peoples wants and needs
she would diverge the conversation remarking "how now you are part of the jocks brother", and clapping amousely, he would retort 
that he doesnt get anything about sports and they probally see him as more a nesecery evil
he laments he probally will have to do most of the work but sis belives sportsmaster will help him "besides you dont look so out of the part, 
you do have some muscle in ya" she would probally say touching him
he would get annoyed and ask her to refrain to touch people without their consent and maybe a funny moment of her poking him untill he snaps and says "ENOUGH!" 
and she continues to be silly
